# Data_Anomalies_and_Fraud_Detection_Python

Detecting anomalies or fraudulent data is crucial in many fields.
However, it can be a challenging task, especially when dealing with newly collected data. 
In this scenario, traditional methods such as regression analysis or hypothesis testing may not be effective since they assume that data follow a certain distribution
or pattern.

However there are several methods that can be used detect anomalies or fraudulent data in newly collected data including:
* 3 Sigma rule
* Heat Maps
* Isolation Forest.
